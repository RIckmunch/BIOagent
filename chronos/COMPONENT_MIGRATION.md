# Component Migration Notes

## Deprecated Components
The following components have been replaced by the new `UnifiedSearch` component:

- **SpineSearch.tsx** → Replaced by UnifiedSearch (modern articles column)
- **HistoricalSearch.tsx** → Replaced by UnifiedSearch (historical articles column)

## Migration Benefits

### Before (Separate Components)
- Two separate search interfaces
- Duplicated search logic
- Separate state management
- More complex layout management

### After (Unified Component)
- Single search interface with dual-column results
- Shared search logic and state
- Cleaner, more intuitive UX
- Parallel search execution for better performance

## Files Affected by Migration

### Updated Files
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Now uses UnifiedSearch instead of separate components
- `src/components/GraphView.tsx` - Enhanced with better visualization and article details
- `src/lib/api.ts` - Already had all necessary methods

### New Files
- `src/components/UnifiedSearch.tsx` - New unified interface
- `UNIFIED_SEARCH_GUIDE.md` - Documentation for new interface
- `E2E_TESTING_WORKFLOW.md` - Testing documentation

### Preserved Files
- `SpineSearch.tsx` and `HistoricalSearch.tsx` are kept for reference but no longer used
- Can be safely removed in future cleanup if desired

## Key Improvements

1. **User Experience**: Single search bar is more intuitive
2. **Performance**: Parallel searches reduce wait time
3. **Visual Design**: Clear distinction between historical and modern results
4. **Maintainability**: Single component is easier to maintain than two separate ones
5. **Extensibility**: Easier to add new features like filters, sorting, etc.

## Next Steps

- Monitor user feedback on the new interface
- Consider adding advanced filtering options
- Potential future cleanup of deprecated component files
- Add more sophisticated graph visualization features
