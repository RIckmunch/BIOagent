# Enhanced Knowledge Graph & Hypothesis Page Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented a separate hypothesis page with enhanced knowledge graph visualization showing paper details and their interconnections. This completes the Bio-X-Agents Chronos project by providing a dedicated interface for cross-temporal research hypothesis generation.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Knowledge Graph Component (`EnhancedKnowledgeGraph.tsx`)

  - üí° **Concepts** (Gray theme)
  - üß† **Hypothesis Connections** (Purple theme)
- Dynamic connection lines showing relationships:
  - **Temporal connections** (Orange) - linking historical and modern concepts
  - **Conceptual connections** (Gray) - showing concept containment
  - **Hypothesis connections** (Purple, dashed) - showing generated hypotheses
- Interactive node selection with detailed information panels
- Automatic concept extraction from article titles, abstracts, and keywords
- Medical terminology similarity matching for cross-temporal concept linking

**Technical Implementation:**

  - Authors, publication dates, journals, PMIDs
  - Full abstracts and keywords
  - Direct links to DOI sources
- **Enhanced knowledge graph visualization** integrated into the page
- **Hypothesis generation panel** with regeneration capabilities
- **Research implications section** with future study suggestions
- **Responsive 3-column layout** optimizing space usage

**Navigation Flow:**
- URL parameters: `/hypothesis?histId=<nodeId>&modernId=<nodeId>`
- Article data persistence via `sessionStorage`
- Automatic hypothesis generation on page load
- Back navigation to main search page

### 3. Enhanced UnifiedSearch Component

**New Features:**
- **"Generate Hypothesis" button** appears when both articles are selected
- **Article data persistence** to sessionStorage for hypothesis page
- **Navigation integration** to hypothesis page with proper URL parameters
- **Visual feedback** with purple-themed call-to-action card
- **Node ID tracking** for both historical and modern article selections

### 4. Knowledge Graph Visualization Features

**Interactive Elements:**
- **Click to select nodes** and view detailed information
- **Zoom controls** (zoom in, zoom out, reset view)
- **Pan navigation** by dragging the canvas
- **Node detail panels** showing article metadata
- **Legend** explaining node types and connection meanings

**Graph Generation Algorithm:**
- Extract key concepts from article titles, abstracts, and keywords
- Create concept nodes linked to their source articles
- Generate cross-temporal connections based on medical terminology matching
- Add hypothesis node when both articles are selected
- Calculate connection strengths based on concept similarity

## User Workflow

### Step 1: Search and Select Articles
1. Use the unified search interface to find articles
2. Select one historical article (pre-2000)
3. Select one modern article (recent studies)
4. Purple "Generate Hypothesis" button appears

### Step 2: Navigate to Hypothesis Page
1. Click "Generate Hypothesis" button
2. Automatically redirected to `/hypothesis` page
3. Article data and node IDs passed via URL and sessionStorage

### Step 3: Explore Knowledge Graph
1. **View the enhanced knowledge graph** showing:
   - Historical and modern article nodes
   - Extracted concept nodes from each article
   - Cross-temporal concept connections
   - Generated hypothesis node (if available)
2. **Interact with the visualization**:
   - Click nodes to see detailed information
   - Use zoom controls to explore different detail levels
   - Pan around to see all connections
3. **Read generated hypothesis** in the dedicated panel
4. **Review research implications** for future studies

### Step 4: Regenerate or Share
1. Use "Regenerate" button to create new hypothesis
2. Use "Share" button to copy hypothesis to clipboard
3. Navigate back to search for new article combinations
