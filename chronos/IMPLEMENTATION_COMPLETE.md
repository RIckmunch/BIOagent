## ðŸš€ Major Accomplishments

### âœ… **Unified Search Interface**
- **Single search bar** that searches both historical (pre-2000) and modern medical literature simultaneously
- **Dual-column results display** with clear visual distinction:
  - Historical articles: Clock icon, amber theme
  - Modern articles: Microscope icon, blue theme
- **Parallel search execution** for improved performance
- **Real-time feedback** with toast notifications and loading states

### âœ… **Enhanced Knowledge Graph Visualization** 
- **Interactive graph display** showing connections between selected articles
- **Rich node visualization** with article metadata and titles
- **Animated connection lines** linking historical observations to modern studies
- **Confidence scoring** with visual progress bars
- **Zoom controls** and responsive design

### âœ… **Robust Backend Infrastructure**
- **Database retry logic** with exponential backoff for Neo4j and Redis connections
- **Separate API endpoints** for historical vs modern article searches
- **Enhanced error handling** and connection recovery
- **Health monitoring** with real-time status checks

### âœ… **Complete End-to-End Workflow**
1. **Search** â†’ Enter medical terms in unified search bar
2. **Select** â†’ Choose historical and modern articles from results
3. **Ingest** â†’ Articles are processed and stored in knowledge graph
4. **Visualize** â†’ Interactive graph shows relationships and connections
5. **Generate** â†’ AI creates cross-temporal research hypotheses
6. **Explore** â†’ Rich visualization with confidence metrics

## ðŸ”¬ **Real-World Testing Results**

### Example Workflow: Tuberculosis Research
**Search Query**: "tuberculosis"

**Historical Results**: 
- Video-Assisted Thoracoscopy (1998)
- Respiratory Cryptococcosis in HIV (1999)
- Rifalazil TB Treatment (1998)

**Modern Results**:
- Deep Vein Thrombosis in HIV Patients (2025)
- Rheumatologic Manifestations (2025)
- Spine Infections (2025)

**Generated Hypothesis**: 
*"Intermittent tuberculosis therapy increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in HIV-positive individuals, leading to higher incidence of undiagnosed DVT and potentially contributing to hospital mortality."*

**Scientific Value**: Connects historical TB treatment protocols with modern cardiovascular complications in immunocompromised patients - a novel research direction.
